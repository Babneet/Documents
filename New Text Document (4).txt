how to populate a value in non-persistant attribute
when we want to setup a non-persistent field to display on UI use the INITVALUE method instead of INIT in case of non-persistent fields.
INITVALUE() for non persistenet and INIT()-Persistenet

what is initValue() and init() methods
The initValue() method is the first method executed after the MBO constructor. It is typically used to initialize attributes on new records and to set default values.
The init() method is called after initValue(). It is typically used to set current attribute as read-only based on some condition.


The Task associated with an Escalation is instantiated only when a specific condition is met. 
Where as a Crontask don't check for any conditions to instantiate the job
Crontask is primarily aimed at executing regular Batch Jobs.
While Escalation is also a Batch Job, but the primary focus is to facilitate ITIL functionality.

Cron task metthods
public void init() throws MXException --- is called by the CronTaskManager when the class is instantiated(When consturctor gets called).
public void start()---is called only when the crontask instance is first loaded and active or when it is reloaded and active.
public void stop()----is called when an active crontask instance is interupted by a reload request, or when the contask manager is shutting down
public void cronAction()-----is the “Core” method of this interface where we implement our logic.
getRunasuserInfo()
crontaskParamInfo[] getParameters()
